## Research Focus

My research interest is in deciphering interfacial phenomena in twisted oxide bilayers by using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Furthermore, I'm mainly focusing on the depth-sectioning-based STEM methodology, which enables the layer-by-layer investigation of atomic and electronic structures in twisted oxides.
